    <h2>Letra de la cancion:</h2><br>
        <p>I hear a lot about sinners
            Don't think that I'll be a saint
            But I might go down to the river, uh
            'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
            Yeah, it's makin' me say</p>

        <p>That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
            On God
            Runnin' to the altar like a track star
            Can't wait another second
            'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy</p>

           <p>I don't do well with the drama
            And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
            No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
            I don't believe in nirvana
            But the way that we love in the night gave me life
            Baby, I can't explain</p>

         <p>That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
            On God
            Runnin' to the altar like a track star
            Can't wait another second
            'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy</p> 

        <p>   They say we're too young and
            The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
            Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
            But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
            They say we're too young and
            The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
            Wise men say, "Fools rush in"
            But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)</p> 

         <p>  The first step pleases the Father
            Might be the hardest to take
            But when you come out of the water
            I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
            Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
            They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
            But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
            Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
            When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
            Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
            I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
            I wanna honor, wanna honor you
            Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
            I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
            If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
            I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
            Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
            Formalize the union in communion He can trust
            I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
            I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us</p> 

        <p>'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy</p>  

        <p>On God
            Runnin' to the altar like a track star
            Can't wait another second</p> 

        <p>On God
            Runnin' to the altar like a track star
            Can't wait another second</p>
         <p>On God
            Runnin' to the altar like a track star
            Can't wait another second</p> 

        <p>'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
            Feels so holy</p>
                <p></p>
